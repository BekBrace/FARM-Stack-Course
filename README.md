Welcome to the FARM Stack course, where you'll embark on a journey to master the art of building robust applications from the ground up using FASTAPI, React, and MongoDB.

# Introduction #
FARM is an acronym representing FastAPI, React, and MongoDB. In this course, we'll leverage these cutting-edge technologies to create a full-fledged application. The stack is designed with a focus on speed, efficiency, and seamless data persistence.

# Technologies #
FastAPI (Backend Server): We'll harness the power of FastAPI to build a robust backend server. FastAPI, developed by Sebastien Ramirez, is a modern web framework that utilizes ASGI, offering lightning-fast response times. One notable advantage is its support for coroutines and concurrency without the need for importing the ASYNCIO module in Python.

React (Frontend Client): The frontend client of our application will be developed using React. This powerful JavaScript library ensures a dynamic and responsive user interface, enhancing the overall user experience.

MongoDB (Backend Database Server): MongoDB serves as our backend database server, providing seamless data persistence. This NoSQL database is a reliable choice for handling large volumes of data and ensuring efficient data retrieval.

# Stack Comparison #
The FARM stack shares similarities with popular stacks like MEAN and MERN. However, it distinguishes itself with the integration of FastAPI, replacing traditional choices like Angular or NodeJs. In MEAN, Angular and NodeJs are utilized, while MERN leverages React and NodeJs. The common thread among these stacks is the combination of React and MongoDB.

# FastAPI Highlights #
FastAPI brings several advantages to the table:

Performance: Thanks to ASGI implementation, FastAPI ensures lightning-fast response times, surpassing traditional frameworks like Express (used in MEAN and MERN stacks).

Concurrency: FastAPI supports coroutines and concurrency without the need for importing the ASYNCIO module in Python.

Interactive API Documentation: FastAPI simplifies testing of various HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) through interactive API documentation. Leveraging OpenAPI, which is based on JSON schema, this feature allows visual testing of different API endpoints.
